\chapter{Introduction}

{\Large\textbf{imapcl}} is an IMAP4rev1\cite{rfc3501} client able to fetch messages from a server. Besides plain-text communication, it also supports communication secured by TLS with the help of the OpenSSL library.

\textit{Implemented extensions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Interactive mode (-i)
%  \item STARTTLS
\end{itemize}

\section{IMAP}

\textbf{IMAP} Version 4rev1 is an application-level protocol that allows for access and manipulation of electronic mail messages on a server. In particular, it supports creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, removing messages and manipulating flags\cite{rfc3501}.

\section{SSL/TLS}

\textbf{TLS} (Transport Layer security) allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way protected against eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery\cite{rfc8446}.

TLS was introduced as a replacement for the SSL 2.0 protocol, which was discovered to be seriously vulnerable, leading to it being abandoned\cite{rfc6176}.

\subsection{Asymmetric cryptography}

\textbf{Asymmetric cryptography} refers to cryptographic methods and algorithms that do not require that the two counterparts share the same key pre-shared over a secure channel, but the key is instead shared during the key exchange process over an insecure channel(e.g. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange). TLS/SSL can be configured for use both with the key exchange algorithm, or with a pre-shared key (TLS-PSK)\cite{rfc8446}.

\subsection{Connection initiation}

TLS works over TCP, hence first a TCP handshake is performed, followed by a TLS handshake. During the TLS handshake, the counterparts negotiate the connection according to their supported protocol versions and cipher suites, exchange and verify each other's certificates against the \textit{authorities} whom the verifying side trusts.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Client sends a \texttt{Client Hello} message to the server, containing its highest \textit{TLS Version} supported, a list of supported \textit{cipher suites}, a \textit{random number} for key generation, followed by standardized extensions and other fields.
  \item Server sends a \texttt{Server Hello} message to the client, including, among other information, the selected \textit{TLS Version}, and the server's \textit{random number}.
  \item The server sends its certificate to the client, and the client may send its certificate to the server upon request to check each other's identity against an authority.
\end{enumerate}

The server may also request additional information from the client instead of sending a \texttt{Server Hello} (a \texttt{Hello Retry Request}), if the server requires additional information\cite{rfc8446}.

\subsection{Certificates and CAs}

A \textbf{certificate} is an authorization token that is signed by a \textit{Certification Authority} (CA), typically using an algorithm like RSA, DSA, or, more recently, ECDSA.

The signature algorithm based on \textbf{RSA} functions as follows (Alice wants to send a signed message to Bob; $d$, $e$ are Alice's private and public keys respectively., $n=pq$ is the modulo; Bob has Alice's public key $e$):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Alice computes $s=hash(m)^{d}\pmod{n}$ and sends it along with $m$.
  \item Bob computes $k=s^{e} \pmod{n}$ and compares if $k = hash(m)$. If it is so, then Bob can be sure that it was indeed Alice who sent the message, because $(h^{e})^{d}=(h^{d})^{e} \pmod{n}$.
\end{enumerate}

A \textbf{Certification Authority} (CA) is a party which is trusted by a group of systems. That is, certificates signed by a CA are viewed by these systems as having the weight of a proof of the counterpart's identity when communicating.

\section{Response Parsing}

\textbf{IMAP} is a comparatively complex protocol, and its context-free grammar asks for a more advanced parsing method than mere regular expression matching. Recursive descent parsers, on the other hand, are widely used for analyzing context-free languages, including network protocols. The parser implementation thus turned out straightforward, albeit requiring some care and debugging.

\section{Messages}

Messages are represented in the design as classes that inherit from either \texttt{Command} or \texttt{Response} abstract classes. Every command has a tag, which is empty for non-tagged commands, and a type, which identifies its role in the protocol. Similarly, every \texttt{Response} has a type and some subclasses have tags. % TODO: Think if it's a correct design

\section{Message receiving}

The response receiving mechanism is designed as a class that notifies the \texttt{Session} object of any incoming message.

\chapter{Implementation}

The program is implemented in \textit{C++20}. In view of limited support for C++20 on the reference machine with \textit{GCC 11.5.0}, not all features of the standard could be used in the project. Nevertheless, the limitations proved to be insignificant to the project as a whole and caused minimal problems.

\item \texttt{make}
\item \texttt{gcc}

\section{Elements}

\subsection{Response parser}

A handwritten backtracking recursive-descent parser is used to parse server responses according to the formal syntax specification in \cite{rfc3501}. The parser structure closely follows the formal specification of the language, but the response grammar is not fully implemented.

\subsection{Session}

The \texttt{Session} class represents a connection to the IMAP server. It features a \textit{finite-state machine} for keeping track of the communication state and \textit{methods} for individual actions like \texttt{fetch}, \texttt{select}, \texttt{search} and \texttt{login}.

\subsection{Command}

The \texttt{Command} class contains \texttt{type} and \texttt{tag} protected members, with the tag being empty for non-tagged responses. They also have a \texttt{make\_tcp()} method, which marshals the command information into the form of a protocol message. Specialized commands contain additional fields and methods for working with relevant data.

\subsection{Response}

The response class has a \texttt{type}, as well as a \texttt{tag} (again, empty for non-tagged responses).

\subsection{Client}

The client class contains a constant structure with regular expressions for command matching, and a read-eval-print loop function that processes user commands.

\subsection{IMFMessage}

IMFMessage is a class for parsing of selected parts of a message in IMF format\cite{rfc5322}. It is only used to generate reasonable file names for downloaded messages. It can parse the \texttt{Date:} header in the message.

\subsection{Receiver}

Receiver is a class whose \texttt{receive} method runs in a separate thread and notifies the Session when there is a new incoming message. TLSReceiver uses TLS/SSL communication instead of plain sockets. The virtual \texttt{receive\_inner} method implements the subclass-specific logic, containing the recv() or SSL\_read() call. Receiver runs in an infinite loop until the \texttt{stopped} value is \texttt{true}. The socket timeout is set up so that it is possible to stop the receiver thread at any time; if recv() times out, the loop checks the \texttt{stopped} value and continues, not notifying the session. If some data was received, the session is immediately notified.

\subsection{Logger}

The \texttt{Logger} class has 3 methods for logging debug information, errors and general information accordingly.

The \texttt{ParserLogger} subclass also has the \texttt{parser\_debug\_log} method for visualizing current depth of call stack, method names, and current character index along with the character itself.

\subsection{Server}

The \texttt{Server} class has a buffer for incoming responses, and constructor which inicializes the connection, as well as a \texttt{receive()} method, returning the received response. The constructor throws an exception if the attempt to establish the connection is unsuccessful.

\section{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Interactive mode does not show messages summary in the beginning.
  \item Argument parsing might fail when \texttt{POSIXLY\_CORRECT} is set and non-flag arguments are not at the very end.
  \item When the program finishes and the destructor of \texttt{Session} is called, there is an inevitable delay of 1 second before the receiver thread times out, leaves uninterruptible sleep, and is joined.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problems}

One of the problems encountered was the inability to set a timeout on a socket when waiting on a TCP handshake part of the \texttt{connect()} call. This was resolved by making the socket non-blocking for the \textit{initialization and connection stage}, and then making it blocking again to work well with the already implemented logic.\cite{timeout-sof}
